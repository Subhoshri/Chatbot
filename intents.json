            "Here's a guide to common baking issues and how to avoid them:\n\n- Cake sinking in the middle: Could be due to overmixing, underbaking, or opening the oven door too soon. Tip: Use room-temperature ingredients and avoid overmixing. Don't open the oven door until the cake is almost done.\n- Dry cake: Caused by overbaking or using too little liquid. Tip: Check your oven temperature with an oven thermometer and measure your ingredients accurately.\n- Hard cookies: Results from overbaking or too much sugar. Tip: Bake just until the edges turn golden and chill the dough if it is too soft.\n- Bread not rising: Could be old yeast or proofing in a cold place. Tip: Always use fresh yeast and proof the dough in a warm, draft-free environment.\n- Dense muffins: Often due to overmixed batter or expired baking powder. Tip: Mix just until combined and check the expiry date on your leavening agents.\n- Pie crust soggy: Caused by underbaking or too much filling moisture. Tip: Blind bake the crust before adding filling and brush with egg wash to seal it.\n- Brownies crumbly: Results from overbaking or wrong fat-to-flour ratio. Tip: Remove brownies from the oven when a few moist crumbs stick to a toothpick.\n- Cheesecake cracking: Overmixing or high baking temperature can cause cracks. Tip: Bake in a water bath at a low temperature and cool gradually.\n- Cookies spreading: Butter too soft or not enough flour. Tip: Chill the dough before baking and donât skip the step of measuring flour properly.\n- Bitter cake taste: Likely from too much baking powder or soda. Tip: Measure leavening agents accurately and sift them into the dry ingredients evenly."
